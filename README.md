# Auto Pilot Project
This Auto Pilot project is an Arduino based effort to create a DIY auto Pilot for a wheel based sail boat.   
This project has three main parts:
1. Navigation Computer 
2. Processor
3. Display 
## Navigation Computer 
An OrangePi Zero 2W running Ubuntu 22.04 and OpenCPN

## Controller
An Arduino Nano 33 IoT connected to an ultimate GPS , an Accelerometer and a motor controller.

## Display
One or more Arduino Nana 33 IoT which both displays the current auto pilot information and has buttons for changing from navigation to compass mode and/or disabling the auto pilot, as well as turning 1 degree, 10 degrees or 90 degrees to port or starboard if in compass mode.
