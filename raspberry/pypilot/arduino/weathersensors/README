The weather sensors read wind speed and direction and output nmea data via the serial (usb port)
Normally wind speed and direction, pressure and air temperature data is output in nmea0183 at 38400 baud


Also read from i2c barometric pressure sensor

There is an optional display and 2 buttons (capacitive touch generally)

This allows for some settings pressing 2 keys.

Also via serial interface it is possible to calibrate and configure.

Two types of sensors are supported
1 - pypilot
   this uses mlx9013 chip which requires calibration to know the analog range (minimum and maximum analog values)
   to calibrate you can type 'calibrate' on a serial console.   This initiates calibration, and after 100 crossing (from minimum to maximum is discontinuous)
   the values are recorded saved and applied

2 - davis
   this works with the davis anemometer which is inferior as it uses a potentiometer with 13 degree deadband
   this is fixed and calibration not needed but the readings are random over this 13 degree interval

It is also possible to configure pressure via a serial console by typing 'config'  the configuration is interactive.
