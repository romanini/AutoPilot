To compile and upload arduino sketches:

sudo apt install arduino


pypilot can communicate with arduinos over serial port

motor - motor controller   binary checksum 4 byte protocol (38400 baud)
        used by pypilot to control motor
weather sensors - nmea0183 wind, presure and air temp (38400 baud)



NOTE, if BAD_FUSES flag is raised, it because the
cheapest arduino clones sometimes have wrong fuses set. If BOD levels are not set then it's possible to cause data corruption from poor wiring which then requires reprogramming.  Better to set fuses correctly.

load arduino isp sketch to one arduino to program another, connect 6 wires as described in arduinoisp sketch

read fuses
avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m328p -U hfuse:r:-:h -U lfuse:r:-:h -U efuse:r:-:h -U lock:r:-:h

0xda
0xff
0x5
0xf

If you get different values, you must correct them such as:

avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m328p -U efuse:w:0x4:m
