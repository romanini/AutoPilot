# Monitor the Auto Pilot UDP stream

This simple python program listens to the UDP broadcasts from the AutoPilot Processor, parses them and prints them out.  This is very useful for debugging purposes.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have python3 installed on your machine
2. Make sure the machine is using the same network (OrangePi by default) as the Auto Pilot Processor
3. From the prompt do:
```
./manitorAutoPilot.py
``
